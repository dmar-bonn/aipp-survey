The field of robotics has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, fueled by the growing 
need for automation and the increasing complexity of tasks required in various domains. One of the 
key challenges in robotics is adaptive informative path planning, which involves planning a trajectory 
for an autonomous robot to follow that maximizes the information acquired about an unknown environment 
while simultaneously respecting resource constraints. This problem is of critical importance in 
applications such as environmental monitoring, exploration, search and rescue, and inspection across 
ground, aerial, and aquatic domains.
