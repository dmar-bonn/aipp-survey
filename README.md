## Abstract

Adaptive informative path planning (AIPP) is important to many robotics applications, enabling mobile robots to 
efficiently collect useful data about initially unknown environments. In addition, learning-based methods are 
increasingly used in robotics to enhance adaptability, versatility, and robustness across diverse and complex 
tasks. Our survey explores research on applying robotic learning to AIPP, bridging the gap between these two 
research fields. We begin by providing a unified mathematical framework for general AIPP problems. Next, we 
establish two complementary taxonomies of current work from the perspectives of (i) learning algorithms and 
(ii) robotic applications. We explore synergies, recent trends, and highlight the benefits of learning-based 
methods in AIPP frameworks. Finally, we discuss key challenges and promising future directions to enable more 
generally applicable and robust robotic data-gathering systems through learning. We provide a comprehensive 
catalogue of papers reviewed in our survey, including publicly available repositories, to facilitate future 
studies in the field.
